## Overview

The PRIME Data Ingestion prototype is part of the Pandemic-Ready Interoperability Modernization Effort, a multi-year collaboration between CDC and the U.S. Digital Service (USDS) to strengthen data quality and information technology systems in state and local health departments.

This project is a time-limited prototype, focused on working with raw ELR, eCR, and VXU data from the commonwealth of Virginia Department of Health, for the purpose of experimenting with a unified data lake paradigm.

The PRIME Data Ingestion prototype a sibling project to [PRIME ReportStream](https://reportstream.cdc.gov), focusing on delivering COVID-19 test data to public health departments, and [PRIME SimpleReport](https://simplereport.gov), working on a better way to report COVID-19 rapid tests.

### Problem Scope

Long-term Vision: Public health systems to digest, analyze, and respond to data are siloed. Lacking access to actionable data, our national, as well as state, local, and territorial infrastructure, isn’t pandemic-ready. Our objective was to learn how the CDC can best support STLTs in moving towards a modern public health data infrastructure.

Short-term prototype: The Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Public Health would like to move towards a more ‘holistic’ solution for electronic data processing and integration, so that currently siloed datasets can be processed and ultimately used in a more efficient and effective manner. Specifically, in order to support the vision of ‘holistic processing’, this prototype is focusing the on seeing what can be done with raw data, focused on COVID-19 breakthrough cases.

### Target Users

Eventual target users of this system include:

- Public Health Departments
  - Epidemiologists who rely on health data to take regular actions
  - Senior stakeholders who make executive decisions using aggregate health data
  - IT teams who have to support epidemiologists and external stakeholders integrating with the PHD
  - PHDs may include state, county, city, and tribal organizations
