# Transform API

A basic API wrapper over our [Transforms Library](https://github.com/CDCgov/prime-public-health-data-infrastructure/tree/main/src/lib/phdi-transforms)

## Architecture

We're using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to get some automatic validation and docs

## Docs

Once running, the `/redoc` endpoint should should display all available endpoints and how to call them
